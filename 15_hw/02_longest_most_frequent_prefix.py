# Write a function that takes unique strings
# and returns the most frequent prefix
# that appears in these strings.
# If there are two or more such prefixes
# the function should return the longest one.
#
# Example
# Input: ["algo", "alloc", "alu", "cat", "catana"]
# Output: "al"
#
# Example
# Input: ["abcd", "efg", "hi"]
# Output: "abcd"
