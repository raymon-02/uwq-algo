# There is an array `prices` of positive integers
# representing the prices of single stock for n days.
#
# Write a functions that takes an array `prices` and positive k
# and returns maximum profit that is possible to make
# using k transactions and holding one share of the stock at a time.
# One transaction means buy stock on one day and sell it on another.
#
# Example
# Input: [5, 11, 3, 50, 60, 90], 2
# Output: 93
# Buy 5, sell 11 => profit is 6
# Buy 3, sell 90 => profit is 87
# Total profit is 6 + 87 = 93
