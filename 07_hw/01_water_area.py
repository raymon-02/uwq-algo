# Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers
# representing the heights of the pillars
# and returns an amount of water trapped between pillars.
#
# Example
# Input: [0, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2]
# Output: 4
# Image with pillars where | is part of a pillar and X means water.
# There are 4 X.
