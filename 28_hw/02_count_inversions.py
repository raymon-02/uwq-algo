# Write a function that takes an array of integers
# and returns the number of inversions in the array.
#
# The inversion occurs when for index i and j
# i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].
#
# Example
# Input: [3, 4, 1, 2]
# Output: 4
# There are 4 inversions. Indices are (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)


def count_inversions(arr):
    pass
