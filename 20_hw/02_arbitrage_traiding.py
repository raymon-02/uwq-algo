# There is a matrix where each element at position (i, j)
# represents exchange rate between currency i and currency j.
# Exchange rate between currency i and i equals to 1.
# Write a function that takes the matrix and returns
# if arbitrage trading is possible using exchanges from the matrix.
# Arbitrage trading means you can start with X units of one currency
# and get more than X units of the same currency performing a series of exchanges.
#
#
# Example
# Input: [
#   [1.0000, 0.8631, 0.5903],
#   [1.1586, 1.0000, 0.6849],
#   [1.6939, 1.4600, 1.0000]
# ]
# Output: True
