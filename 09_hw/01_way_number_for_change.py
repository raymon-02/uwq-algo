# There is an array `denoms` of positive integers
# representing coin denominations.
#
# Write a function that takes the array and positive integer
# representing a target amount
# and returns the number of ways
# to make change for the target amount
# using the given coin denominations from the array.
# Each coin denomination can be used unlimited amount of time.
#
# Example
# Input: 6, [1, 5]
# Output: 2
# 1 time * 1 + 1 time * 5 = 6  => 1
# 6 times * 1 = 6              => 1
# Total ways 1 + 1 = 2
