# Write a function that takes two positive integers
# and returns the number of ways from the top left corner
# to reach the bottom right corner
# in the grid-shaped rectangular graph
# with width and height of the input integers.
#
# Example
# Input: 2, 3
# Output: 3
# Graph:
#  _ _ _
# |_|_|_|
# |_|_|_|
# Possible ways:
# 1. right, right, down
# 2. right, down, right
# 3. down, right, right
# Total ways = 3
