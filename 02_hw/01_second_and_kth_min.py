# Write a function that takes array of integers and returns the second minimum.
# The array can contain duplicate integers.
# The second minimum should be different from the first minimum.
# If there is no second minimum function should return None.
#
# Example
# Input: [10, 4, 2, -9, 15]
# Output: 2
# The first minimum is -9, the second minimum is 2.
#
# Example
# Input: [10, 4, 2, -9, 15, -9, 2, 2, -9]
# Output: 2
# The first minimum is -9, the second minimum is 2.
#
# Example
# Input: [1, 1, 1]
# Output: None
# The first minimum is 1 and there are no more other numbers.


def second_min(arr):
    pass


# The same condition as above but function should return kth minimum.
# If there is no kth minimum function should return None.
#
# Example
# Input: [10, 4, 2, -9, 15], 4
# Output: 10
# k equals to 4, then function should return the forth minimum.
# The first minimum is -9, the second minimum is 2, the third minimum is 4, the fourth minimum is 10
#
# Example
# Input: [10, 4, 2, -9, 15, -9, 2, 2, -9], 4
# Output: 10
# k equals to 4, then function should return the forth minimum
# The first minimum is -9, the second minimum is 2, the third minimum is 4, the fourth minimum is 10
#
# Example
# Input: [1, 1, 2, 3, 1], 4
# Output: None
# k equals to 4, then function should return the forth minimum
# The first minimum is 1, the second minimum is 2, the third minimum is 3 and there are no more other numbers.
