# Write a function that takes an array of requests
# where each request is a string representing type of the request
# and a value.
#
# If type of the request is "add" with value x then
# point with coordinate x should be remembered.
#
# If type of the request is "search" with value of pair (l, r) then
# a count of points existing between coordinates l and r inclusive
# should be added into result array.
#
# Point coordinate is an integer x where 0 <= x <= 10^6
#
# Example
# Input:
#   [
#     ("search", (1, 4)),
#     ("add", 1),
#     ("add", 2),
#     ("search", (1, 4))
#     ("search", (2, 100))
#   ]
# Example: [0, 2, 1]
