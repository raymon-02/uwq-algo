# Write a function that takes weighted graph in adjacency format
# and returns a graph in adjacency format representing minimum spanning tree of the initial graph.
#
# A minimum spanning tree of the graph is a tree containing all vertices and subset of edges.
# These edges should connect all vertices with minimum total edge weight and without cycles.
#
# The function should implement Prim algorithm.
#
# Example
# Input: [
#   [(1, 3), (2, 5)],
#   [(0, 3), (2, 10), (3, 12)],
#   [(0, 5), (1, 10)],
#   [(1, 12)]
# ]
# Output: [
#   [(1, 3), (2, 5)],
#   [(0, 3), (3, 12)],
#   [(0, 5)],
#   [(1, 12)]
# ]
