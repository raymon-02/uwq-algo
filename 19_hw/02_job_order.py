# There are list of integers representing jobs to complete
# and list of pairs of integers where each pair represents job dependencies.
# The second job in pair depends on the first one.
# Write a function that takes these two arrays
# and returns jobs in valid order to complete.
# If there is no such order the function should return empty array.
#
# Example
# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], [(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)]
# Output: [4, 1, 3, 2]
