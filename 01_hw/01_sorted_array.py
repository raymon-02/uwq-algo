# You have two arrays with lengths N and N+M accordingly.
# The first array with length N contains N integers in sorted order.
# The second array with length M+N contains M integers at the first M indexes in sorted order
# and None values at the next N indexes.
# Write a function that takes N, M and such two arrays
# and returns the array of length N+M containing all elements in sorted order from the initial arrays.
# You can modify initial arrays.

# Example
# Input: 4, 2, [1, 3, 5, 5], [2, 10, None, None, None]
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 10]
