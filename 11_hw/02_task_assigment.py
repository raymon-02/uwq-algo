# There are integer k representing number of workers
# and an array of positive integers representing duration of tasks.
# The length of the array is 2k. Each worker must complete 2 tasks.
#
# Write a function that takes k and the array
# and returns an array representing
# the optimal assignment of tasks to each worker.
# The length of the returned array is k.
# Each element in the returned array is an array ot two elements
# where each of two elements are indices of tasks
# that are assigned on worker.
#
# Example
# Input: 3, [1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 4]
# Output: [[0, 2], [4, 5], [1, 3]]
# Tasks 0 and 2 are assigned on worker 0 and will take 1+5=6.
# Tasks 4 and 5 are assigned on worker 1 and will take 1+4=5.
# Tasks 1 and 3 are assigned on worker 2 and will take 3+3=6.
