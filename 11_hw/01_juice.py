# Write a function that takes prices of juice
# and returns the indices of prices from which
# the maximum profit can be constructed.
# Each price under index i represents i amount of juice
# and the maximum amount of juice is n - 1
# where n is a length of prices.
#
# Each amount of juice can be used multiple times.
#
# At index 0 in prices there will be always 0 value
# as price for 0 amount of juice is 0.
#
# Example
# Input: [0, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: [1, 2]
# The maximum amount of juice is 3 as length of prices is 4.
# 1 amount of juice has price 1.
# 2 amount of juice has price 3.
# In sum it is 1+2=3 amount of juice with profit 1+3=4.
# This is the maximum profit that can be constructed
# having 3 amount of juice in total.
#
# Example
# Input: [0, 2, 3]
# Output: [1, 1]
# The maximum amount of juice is 2 as length of prices is 3.
# 1 amount of juice has price 2.
# We can use 1 amount of juice multiple times.
# In sum it is 1+1=2 amount of juice with profit 2+2=4.
# This is the maximum profit that can be constructed
# having 2 amount of juice in total.
