# Write a function that takes string of digits
# and returns all possible mnemonics
# associated with keypad of mobile phone.
#
# Each button of keypad contains digit and letters like:
# 1 has no letters
# 2 has 'a', 'b', 'c'
# 3 has 'd', 'e', 'f'
# 4 has 'g', 'h', 'i'
# 5 has 'j', 'k', 'l'
# 6 has 'm', 'n', 'o'
# 7 has 'p', 'q', 'r', 's'
# 8 has 't', 'u', 'v'
# 9 has 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'
# 0 has no letters
#
# So input string "234" can be presented
# like "aei" or "bfg" or "cdh" and so on.
#
# If digit has no letters then it should be presented as is.
#
# Example
# Input: "290"
# Output: ["aw0", "ax0", "ay0", "az0", "bw0", "bx0", "by0", "bz0", "cw0", "cx0", "cy0", "cz0"]
