# There is an array of pairs of integers
# where each pair represents train arrival and departure time.
# Write a function that takes the array
# and returns the minimum number of platform that is required
# not to overlap train stops.
#
# Example
# Input: [(900, 910), (940, 1200), (950, 1120), (1100, 1130), (1500, 1900), (1800, 2000)]
# Output: 3
