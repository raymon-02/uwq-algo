# There are a list of string representing name of airports,
# list of pairs of strings representing routes between two airports
# and string representing starting airport.
# Write a function that takes these two lists and string
# and returns the minimum number of routes that needs to be added
# to be able to reach any airport in the list starting from the starting airport.
#
# Example
# Input:
# ["LED", "PEE", "FCO, ""BER", "SFO"],
# [
#   ["PEE", "LED"],
#   ["LED", "PEE"],
#   ["BER", "SFO"],
#   ["SFO", "FCO"]
# ],
# "PEE"
