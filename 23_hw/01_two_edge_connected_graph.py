# Write a function that takes graph in adjacency format
# and returns boolean representing if the graph is two edge connected.
#
# A graph is called two edge connected
# if it stays connected after removal any edge from it.
#
# Example
# Input: [
#   [1, 2, 5],
#   [0, 2],
#   [0, 1, 3],
#   [2, 4, 5],
#   [3, 5],
#   [0, 3, 4]
# ]
# Output: True
