# There is an array consisting of triples.
# Each triple represents original unit, destination unit
# and multiplier between them.
#
# Write a function that takes the array and two units
# and returns the conversion rate between them
# using DSU data structure.
#
# Example:
# Input: [("foot", "yard", 0.333), ("foot", "inch", 12)], "inch", "yard"
# Output: 0.0277
